## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Multi-Agent System
```
Portfolio Manager (Orchestrator)
├── Query Analyzer (Clinical Analysis)
├── Data Verifier (SDV & Compliance)  
├── Query Generator (Medical Writing)
└── Query Tracker (Lifecycle Management)
```

### Workflow Patterns
1. **Query Resolution**: Portfolio Manager → Query Analyzer → Query Generator → Query Tracker
2. **Data Verification**: Portfolio Manager → Data Verifier → Query Generator → Query Tracker  
3. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Portfolio Manager → Query Analyzer → Data Verifier → Query Generator → Query Tracker

### Technical Stack
- **AI Framework**: OpenAI Agents SDK (real, not mock)
- **API Layer**: FastAPI with comprehensive endpoints
- **Context Management**: Pydantic BaseModel classes
- **Function Tools**: String-based with JSON serialization
- **Deployment**: Railway.app ready with environment configuration

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (Week 1-2)

### CRITICAL Priority
1. **Configure OpenAI API Key** (User Action Required)
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Add actual OpenAI API key
   - Test system with real API calls

2. **Implement Safety Workflows** (Development Task)
   - SAE immediate escalation pathways
   - Medical monitor notification system
   - Regulatory timeline compliance (24-hour reporting)

### HIGH Priority  
3. **Clinical Domain Enhancement** (Development Task)
   - Enhance agent prompts with medical expertise
   - Add ICH-GCP section references
   - Implement study phase awareness

4. **Production Readiness** (DevOps Task)
   - Monitoring and alerting systems
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Performance optimization

## 🏥 Clinical Domain Assessment

### Current Strengths
- **Medical Terminology**: Basic standardization implemented
