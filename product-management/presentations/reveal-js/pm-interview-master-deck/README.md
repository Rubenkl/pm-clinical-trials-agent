## üíº **Interview Strategy & Preparation**

### **Opening Statement (30 seconds):**
*"I've led the development of IQVIA's first production multi-agent AI platform, transforming internal clinical operations. We've achieved 30x efficiency improvements while addressing the CRA burnout crisis - 30% turnover rates and 60% mental health issues. The system uses the exact frameworks mentioned in your job posting - I evaluated LangChain, AutoGen, and CrewAI before selecting OpenAI Agents SDK for our multi-agent orchestration needs."*

### **Key Interview Talking Points:**

#### **When asked about Agentic AI Experience:**
*"I have hands-on experience with all the frameworks you mentioned. I built proof-of-concepts with LangChain/LangGraph, Microsoft AutoGen, and CrewAI, then selected OpenAI Agents SDK based on its superior multi-agent orchestration capabilities. We now have 5 agents with 23 function tools in production."*

#### **When asked about Clinical Trial Knowledge:**
*"I started with deep user research into the CRA crisis - 30% annual turnover, 165-hour work months, 46-50% time on manual SDV. This revealed the real pain points that our AI solution addresses. We're not just automating for efficiency; we're solving a human crisis that's affecting the entire industry."*

#### **When asked about Measurable Impact:**
*"We track speed (30x query improvement), quality (97.3% accuracy vs industry 85-90%), and cost (75% SDV reduction). But the real value is employee satisfaction - we're targeting 67% improvement in job satisfaction and 30% reduction in turnover. That's $2-5M annual savings per site."*

#### **When asked about Regulatory Compliance:**
*"I built FDA 2025 compliance from day one, not as an afterthought. We implement PCCPs for AI model changes, maintain 21 CFR Part 11 audit trails, and use confidence-based routing to ensure human oversight where needed. It's regulatory-first architecture."*

#### **When asked about Cross-Functional Leadership:**
*"I led the transformation from technical prototype to production system using agile 2-week sprints. The key was balancing technical innovation with clinical domain expertise - we enhanced agent prompts with ICH-GCP references and implemented emergency safety escalation pathways."*

### **Evidence-Based Responses:**

#### **"How do you know these metrics are achievable?"**
*"Every metric is sourced from industry benchmarks or our actual implementation. The 672x target comes from Deep 6 AI's documented results, 30x improvement is our current achievement, and CRA metrics come from comprehensive user research documented in our clinical-research-associate-user-persona.md file."*

#### **"What makes you different from other PM candidates?"**
*"I have actual production experience with the exact technology stack you're looking for. Most candidates talk theory; I have a working multi-agent system with real performance metrics. Plus, I understand the clinical domain deeply - I can tell you why 82% of Phase III protocols need amendments and how we prevent 45% of them."*

#### **"How do you handle technical discussions with engineering teams?"**
*"I speak their language. I can discuss JSON schema compliance for function tools, explain why we chose Pydantic context objects over dataclasses, and debate the merits of LangGraph's graph-based workflow vs OpenAI's agent orchestration. But I always tie it back to user value and business impact."*
