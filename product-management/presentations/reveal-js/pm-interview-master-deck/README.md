- FDA compliance implementation
- Pilot site deployment

### Phase 3: Scale (Months 13-18) üéØ PLANNED
- Deviation Scanner Agent
- Full ecosystem deployment
- Enterprise-wide rollout
- 672x efficiency target

## üíº Interview Talking Points

### When asked about Product Strategy:
"I identified a $53.9B inefficiency crisis through user research with CRAs experiencing 30% turnover rates. Industry leaders like Pfizer and Deep 6 AI have achieved 40-672x improvements, validating the market opportunity."

### When asked about Technical Decisions:
"I selected OpenAI Agents SDK over LangChain and AutoGen based on clinical-first design, regulatory compliance, and 8-12 week implementation timeline vs 6+ months for alternatives."

### When asked about Risk Management:
"I implemented confidence-based routing where 95%+ confidence enables full automation, while <95% maintains human oversight, ensuring both efficiency and safety."

### When asked about Metrics:
"We track leading indicators like API response time and accuracy, plus lagging indicators like CRA turnover reduction and trial timeline acceleration, with 233-483% ROI validated."
