# Presentation Delivery Plan - PM Clinical Trials Agent
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Format:** All presentations in Reveal.js
**Purpose:** Comprehensive plan for all product management presentations

---

## ðŸ§ª Test-Driven Development for Presentations

### Core TDD Principle
Every Reveal.js presentation follows test-driven development:
1. **Write tests first** - Define what success looks like before creating content
2. **Tests fail initially** - All tests should fail before implementation
3. **Build to pass tests** - Create presentation elements to satisfy tests
4. **Refactor with confidence** - Tests ensure quality during iterations

### Testing Tools for Reveal.js
- **Jest**: Unit testing for JavaScript functionality
- **Puppeteer**: End-to-end presentation testing
- **Percy/BackstopJS**: Visual regression testing
- **axe-core**: Accessibility compliance testing
- **Lighthouse**: Performance testing

### Test-First Workflow
```bash
# 1. Create test file for presentation
npm run test:create week01-vision-strategy

# 2. Write tests (they will fail)
npm run test week01-vision-strategy

# 3. Build presentation to pass tests
npm run dev week01-vision-strategy

# 4. Run tests continuously during development
npm run test:watch week01-vision-strategy

# 5. Final validation before delivery
npm run test:all
```
