# Current Sprint Status - PM Clinical Trials Agent

**Last Updated:** July 11, 2025  
**Current Sprint:** Sprint 7 - Clinical Domain Enhancement  
**Sprint Duration:** July 1-14, 2025  
**Status:** In Progress

## üìã Sprint Goal

Transform technical foundation into clinically-validated production system ready for medical expert review and pilot deployment.

## üéØ Current Focus Areas

### 1. Critical Safety Workflows (60% capacity)
- [ ] Implement emergency safety escalation pathways
- [ ] Add SAE (Serious Adverse Event) immediate notification system  
- [ ] Create medical monitor escalation workflows
- [ ] Implement regulatory timeline compliance (24-hour SAE reporting)
- [ ] Add study phase awareness (Phase I/II/III/IV differentiation)

**Status**: Not yet started - these are documented requirements but not implemented in code

### 2. Clinical Domain Expertise (25% capacity)
- [x] AI agents using real medical reasoning (GPT-4)
- [ ] Enhance agent prompts with ICH-GCP section references
- [ ] Add therapeutic area-specific logic
- [ ] Implement clinical significance assessment for lab values
- [ ] Create clinical context awareness

**Status**: Partially complete - AI intelligence implemented but domain expertise needs enhancement

### 3. Production Readiness (15% capacity)
- [x] Basic error handling implemented
- [ ] Production monitoring and alerting  
- [x] Railway deployment configuration ready
- [ ] Complete audit trails for regulatory compliance
- [ ] Performance optimization for OpenAI API calls

**Status**: Deployment ready but missing production monitoring

## üìä Sprint Progress

| Area | Target | Completed | Remaining |
|------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Safety Workflows | 5 tasks | 0 | 5 |
| Clinical Domain | 5 tasks | 1 | 4 |
| Production Ready | 5 tasks | 2 | 3 |
| **Total** | **15 tasks** | **3** | **12** |

**Sprint Completion**: 20%

## üö® Blockers & Risks

1. **Safety Workflows Not Implemented**: Critical gap for production deployment
2. **No Authentication System**: Security requirement for healthcare data
3. **Clinical Expert Review Pending**: Need validation before pilot
4. **Production Monitoring Gap**: No alerting for system issues

## üìÖ Key Dates

- **Sprint Start**: July 1, 2025
- **Mid-Sprint Check**: July 7, 2025 ‚úÖ
- **Demo Day**: July 11, 2025 (Today)
- **Sprint End**: July 14, 2025
- **Sprint Review**: July 14, 2025

## üéØ Definition of Done

- [ ] All code has 100% test coverage
- [ ] Documentation updated in MASTER_DOCUMENTATION.md
- [ ] API endpoints tested and documented
- [ ] Clinical workflows validated by expert
- [ ] Production deployment checklist completed
- [ ] Security review passed

## üìù Notes

- AI implementation was completed in January 2025
- System has been in "late development/early production" since then
- Critical safety features remain unimplemented
- Need to prioritize safety workflows before pilot deployment

## üîÑ Next Sprint Preview

**Sprint 8: Production Deployment Preparation**
- Complete authentication system
- Implement remaining safety workflows
- Clinical expert validation sessions
- Load testing and performance optimization
- Pilot site selection and preparation
