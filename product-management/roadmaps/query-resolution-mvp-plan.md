    instructions="""You coordinate the Query Resolution workflow:
    1. Receive data discrepancy reports
    2. Handoff to Query Analyzer for analysis
    3. Handoff to Query Generator for query creation
    4. Handoff to Query Tracker for monitoring
    5. Report final status and metrics""",
    handoffs=[
        analyzer_handoff,
        generator_handoff,
        tracker_handoff
    ]
)

# Handoff definitions
analyzer_handoff = Handoff(
    target=query_analyzer,
    condition="when data needs analysis for discrepancies",
    context_transfer=["data_points", "trial_metadata"]
)

generator_handoff = Handoff(
    target=query_generator,
    condition="when queries need to be generated",
    context_transfer=["analysis_results", "site_preferences"]
)

tracker_handoff = Handoff(
    target=query_tracker,
    condition="when queries need tracking or follow-up",
    context_transfer=["generated_queries", "sla_requirements"]
)
```

## üöÄ Quick Start Implementation

### Step 1: Clone and Setup
```bash
cd backend/app/agents/
# Create new agent files
touch query_generator.py query_tracker.py
```

### Step 2: Query Generator Template
```python
from app.agents.base_agent import ClinicalTrialsAgent
from openai_agents import function_tool
from typing import Dict, List, Any

class QueryGenerator(ClinicalTrialsAgent):
    """Generates clinical trial queries based on analysis results."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            agent_id="query-generator",
            name="Query Generator",
            description="Generates contextually appropriate clinical queries",
            model="gpt-4",
            temperature=0.3
        )
        
    @function_tool
    async def generate_query(self, analysis: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Generate a clinical query from analysis results."""
        # Implementation here
        pass
```

### Step 3: Query Tracker Template
```python
class QueryTracker(ClinicalTrialsAgent):
    """Tracks and manages query lifecycle."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            agent_id="query-tracker",
            name="Query Tracker",
            description="Monitors query status and automates follow-ups",
            model="gpt-4",
            temperature=0.1
        )
        
    @function_tool
    async def track_query(self, query: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Track query status and trigger follow-ups."""
        # Implementation here
        pass
```

## üîç Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Integration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Use SDK's built-in handoff patterns
   - Fallback: Direct function calls if handoffs fail

2. **Performance at Scale**
   - Mitigation: Implement caching and batch processing
   - Fallback: Queue-based processing for high loads

3. **Language Model Costs**
   - Mitigation: Use GPT-3.5 for non-critical tasks
   - Fallback: Template-based generation for common queries
