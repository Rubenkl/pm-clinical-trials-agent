# Principal investigator personas shape clinical trial success

Clinical trial Principal Investigators (PIs) face unprecedented challenges, with 54.2% becoming "one-and-done" investigators who never conduct another trial. Understanding distinct PI personas across practice settings is crucial for sponsors and CROs seeking to improve site relationships, reduce protocol amendments that affect 75% of trials, and address the reality that 11% of sites fail to enroll a single patient.

## The academic innovator: Dr. Sarah Chen, MD, PhD

Dr. Chen serves as Associate Professor of Oncology at a major academic medical center, balancing clinical duties, teaching responsibilities, and research activities. With 12 years of PI experience, she currently manages 8 concurrent trials ranging from Phase I first-in-human studies to Phase III registration trials.

**Time allocation reveals competing priorities.** Dr. Chen dedicates 40% of her time to research activities, protected through her academic appointment. Her remaining time splits between clinical practice (35%), teaching medical students and fellows (15%), and administrative duties (10%). During protocol amendment implementations, which occur on average 3.3 times per Phase III trial, her research time temporarily increases to 60% to manage training and regulatory requirements.

**Scientific advancement drives participation.** Like 74.4% of academic PIs, Dr. Chen's primary motivation centers on contributing to medical science and advancing cancer treatment options. Publication opportunities rank highly, with tenure considerations and grant funding serving as secondary motivators. Financial compensation, while important for supporting her research team, represents only 17.8% of her decision-making factors.

**Technology adoption remains selective.** Dr. Chen's institution has integrated EMR-to-EDC systems, achieving 90% faster form completion for her trials. She embraces eConsent platforms, experiencing a 57% reduction in consent deviations. However, she resists adopting multiple disparate systems, preferring unified platforms that reduce the 5-15 hours monthly her team spends on technology training.

**Systemic inefficiencies create major frustrations.** Query resolution consumes significant time, with her team managing queries that cost between $28-$225 each to resolve. The 51% of queries related to simple errors like missing signatures particularly frustrate her. Protocol complexity has doubled since 2010, and Dr. Chen struggles with protocols requiring amendments that extend trial duration by an average of 3 months.

**Infrastructure limitations despite resources.** While her academic center provides dedicated research coordinators and specialized facilities, IRB approval timelines average 60-90 days. Competing priorities between teaching, clinical care, and research create scheduling conflicts. With 23% of sites experiencing 90+ day payment delays, even well-resourced academic centers face cash flow challenges that impact operations.

## The community champion: Dr. Michael Rodriguez, MD

Dr. Rodriguez practices internal medicine at a 250-bed community hospital, where he's built a modest research program over the past 5 years. He currently manages 3 Phase III trials in diabetes and cardiovascular disease while maintaining a full clinical practice.

**Clinical practice dominates schedule.** Dr. Rodriguez allocates 85% of his time to patient care, squeezing research activities into the remaining 15%. He relies heavily on his single research coordinator, who manages most day-to-day trial operations. During site initiation visits and monitoring visits, he often works evenings and weekends to maintain both responsibilities.

**Patient access motivates participation.** Dr. Rodriguez primarily conducts trials to provide his rural patient population access to innovative treatments they couldn't otherwise receive. This aligns with 67.8% of community PIs who cite improving patient medical conditions as their primary motivation. The additional revenue helps support his research coordinator's salary, but financial considerations remain secondary.

**Pragmatic technology approach prevails.** With limited IT support, Dr. Rodriguez prefers simple, integrated solutions. His site uses basic EDC systems but struggles with the 40% of sites spending 5-15 hours monthly on unpaid technology training. He's interested in eConsent but lacks resources for implementation. Remote monitoring adopted during COVID-19 has reduced his site visit burden by 30%.

**Resource constraints create daily challenges.** Operating with minimal infrastructure, Dr. Rodriguez faces constant frustrations. The administrative burden is significant - his site spends 8.8 hours weekly managing study documents. With only 6 months of operating capital (like 26% of sites), payment delays severely impact operations. He nearly dropped out after his first trial, joining the 63.8% of "one-and-done" PIs who cite workload balance as burdensome.

**Support needs remain unmet.** Dr. Rodriguez requires comprehensive training support but often receives minimal assistance. He needs help with recruitment strategies, as his screening-to-enrollment ratio of 6:1 exceeds the industry average. Regulatory support is critical - his coordinator spends 8.0 hours weekly on initial regulatory file preparation. Without dedicated research infrastructure, every aspect of trial conduct requires external support.

## The entrepreneurial investigator: Dr. Patricia Williams, MD

Dr. Williams left academic medicine to establish a private dermatology practice 8 years ago. She discovered clinical trials could diversify revenue while advancing treatment options for her psoriasis and eczema patients. She now dedicates two days weekly to research activities.

**Business model drives time allocation.** Dr. Williams strategically allocates 30% of her time to research, generating $350,000 annually from 4 concurrent trials. This supplements her clinical practice income while requiring minimal infrastructure investment. She employs two part-time research coordinators and has developed efficient workflows that minimize disruption to her practice.

**Multiple motivations align strategically.** Financial considerations play a larger role for Dr. Williams than academic PIs, though scientific interest remains primary. With private practice physicians earning an average of $385,000 versus $320,000 for employed physicians, trials provide important revenue diversification. She carefully selects trials that align with her patient population's needs while offering adequate compensation.

**Technology investment yields returns.** Dr. Williams invested in integrated CTMS and eSource solutions, reducing data entry time by 61%. She was an early adopter of eConsent, improving enrollment rates and patient satisfaction. Her 95% query resolution rate within 24 hours ranks among the industry's best. However, she avoids trials requiring multiple incompatible systems that would strain her lean operations.

**Efficiency demands drive frustrations.** Protocol amendments significantly impact Dr. Williams' practice, requiring schedule adjustments and staff overtime. With 75% of protocols requiring amendments, she now screens protocols more carefully during feasibility. Payment delays affect 23% of sites for 90+ days, forcing her to maintain a credit line. She's particularly frustrated by sponsors who don't understand private practice economics.

**Business-minded support needs.** Dr. Williams needs sponsors who understand ROI requirements for private practice participation. She values transparent budgets with adequate startup costs and prompt payment terms. Technology training must be efficient and compensated. She prefers sponsors offering recruitment support materials and established referral networks. Clear communication about protocol complexity during feasibility is essential for her business planning.

## The research specialist: Dr. James Thompson, MD

Dr. Thompson transitioned from clinical practice to become Medical Director of a dedicated research site 7 years ago. His 10,000-square-foot facility conducts 15-20 concurrent trials across multiple therapeutic areas, from vaccines to rare diseases.

**Research focus enables efficiency.** Dr. Thompson dedicates 70% of his time to trial-related activities, with the remaining 30% split between business development and site operations. His team of 15 includes specialized coordinators for different therapeutic areas. This focus enables his site to activate trials 40% faster than traditional sites and maintain enrollment rates 25% above industry averages.

**Professional fulfillment through volume.** While scientific contribution motivates Dr. Thompson, he also finds satisfaction in operational excellence. His site's ability to conduct multiple trials efficiently allows broader impact across therapeutic areas. Financial sustainability is crucial - his site requires consistent trial flow to maintain operations, making sponsor relationships and reputation critical.

**Technology leadership differentiates operations.** Dr. Thompson's site serves as a beta testing location for new clinical trial technologies. They've achieved 90% faster form completion through EMR integration and maintain 99% EDC data quality scores. His team manages 8 different EDC systems simultaneously through standardized SOPs. Investment in technology training reduces their monthly training burden to under 5 hours per study.

**Operational challenges persist at scale.** Despite efficiencies, Dr. Thompson faces unique frustrations. Managing relationships with 12 different sponsors requires diplomatic balance. His site experiences the industry's full range of payment delays, with 31-40% of invoices overdue beyond 90 days. Staff retention remains challenging - losing an experienced coordinator can impact multiple trials simultaneously.

**Partnership approach to sponsor relationships.** Dr. Thompson seeks true partnerships with sponsors, not transactional relationships. He needs predictable trial flow for business planning and prefers master agreements that streamline contracting. His site invests in sponsor-specific training to become preferred providers. He values sponsors who involve sites in protocol development and provide adequate budgets for quality delivery.

## Common threads and critical insights

These personas reveal universal challenges transcending practice settings. Payment delays affect operations regardless of site type, with 80% of sites maintaining only 6 months or less operating capital. Technology adoption accelerates but requires significant training investment that often goes uncompensated. Protocol complexity continues increasing, with amendments affecting 75% of trials and adding an average of 3 months to timeline.

The most successful PI-sponsor relationships recognize these realities. Sites reporting high satisfaction cite communication quality and responsiveness as top attributes. Those conducting multiple trials successfully balance operational efficiency with scientific rigor. Understanding these distinct personas enables sponsors to tailor support strategies, ultimately improving trial outcomes and reducing the alarming 54.2% rate of one-and-done investigators.
