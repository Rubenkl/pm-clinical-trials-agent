# Comprehensive Clinical Research Coordinator User Personas

## Understanding the CRC landscape through data-driven personas

Clinical Research Coordinators serve as the operational backbone of clinical trials, managing complex workflows while balancing patient care, regulatory compliance, and stakeholder communications. This comprehensive analysis presents three detailed personas representing CRCs across different organizational settings, incorporating extensive research on workflows, pain points, technology use, and career trajectories.

## Persona 1: Sarah Chen - Academic Medical Center CRC

### Background and Context
**Age:** 32  
**Experience:** 5 years as CRC, 2 years prior as clinical nurse  
**Setting:** Large academic medical center with 800+ beds  
**Studies Managed:** 3 concurrent oncology trials  
**Certifications:** ACRP CCRC, oncology-specific training  

### Daily Workflow Breakdown

Sarah's typical day reflects the complexity of academic medical center operations:

**7:00-8:00 AM**: Email review and daily planning (60-90 emails daily, 30% non-essential)  
**8:00-9:00 AM**: Pre-visit preparation and chart reviews (15-30 minutes per patient)  
**9:00-12:00 PM**: Patient visits and procedures (3-4 patients, 90-120 minutes each)  
**12:00-1:00 PM**: Working lunch - administrative catch-up, query responses  
**1:00-4:00 PM**: Documentation and CRF completion (90-120 minutes of data entry)  
**4:00-5:00 PM**: Follow-up calls, scheduling coordination  
**5:00-6:00 PM**: Monitoring visit preparation, regulatory updates  

**Time allocation breakdown:**
- **Administrative tasks & documentation**: 45% of daily time
- **Direct patient care**: 30% of daily time  
- **Regulatory compliance**: 20% of daily time
- **Communication & coordination**: 15% of daily time

### Pain Points Ranked by Impact and Frequency

1. **Duplicate data entry** (Daily, High Impact): Enters same data in hospital EMR, sponsor EDC, and regulatory binders - average 3+ systems per patient visit
2. **Mid-study database updates** (Monthly, High Impact): Average 4.1 planned and 3.7 unplanned updates per trial causing workflow disruptions
3. **Query resolution burden** (Weekly, Medium-High Impact): 30-60 minutes daily resolving queries, with complex historical queries taking significantly longer
4. **Multiple system logins** (Daily, Medium Impact): Manages 7 different platforms with separate credentials, losing 15-20 minutes daily
5. **Bureaucratic delays** (Weekly, Medium Impact): IRB amendments take 3-4 weeks, slowing protocol implementation

### Technology Profile

**Comfort Level:** Moderate to High (7/10)  
**Systems Used:**

- **Clarity issues**: 40% of queries require clarification before resolution
- **Historical data challenges**: Retrospective queries for 6+ month old data particularly difficult
- **System navigation**: Different query interfaces for each EDC platform

"The worst part is when monitors ask for data that's clearly in the source documents I already uploaded. It feels like they don't even look before sending queries."

### Documentation Burden Analysis

**Daily documentation requirements:**
- CRF completion: 90-120 minutes
- Source documentation: 45-60 minutes

## The Future CRC

The research reveals that successful CRCs of the future will need to balance high-tech capabilities with high-touch patient care. Organizations that invest in comprehensive support systems—including competitive compensation (ranging from $52,000 for entry-level to $95,000+ for senior roles), manageable workloads (maximum 2-3 concurrent studies), and integrated technology platforms—will attract and retain top talent.

The profession faces a critical juncture: with trial complexity increasing and experienced CRCs burning out at alarming rates (44% report emotional exhaustion), the industry must act decisively to support these essential team members. The path forward requires coordinated effort from all stakeholders to address systemic inefficiencies, invest in purpose-built technology, and recognize CRCs as the skilled professionals they are.

These personas demonstrate that while CRCs share common challenges across settings, their specific needs vary significantly based on organizational context, therapeutic area, and career stage. Solutions must be flexible enough to address this diversity while maintaining the standardization necessary for efficient clinical research operations.
