# Railway Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Deploy to Railway (3 steps, 3 minutes)

### **Step 1: Push to GitHub**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to Railway"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 2: Deploy via Railway Dashboard**
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "Deploy Now" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select repository: `pm-clinical-trials-agent`
4. Railway should auto-detect the `railway.toml` configuration (uses Nixpacks)
5. If not, manually set:
   - **Builder**: Nixpacks
   - **Build Command**: `cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
6. Add environment variable: `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here`
7. Click "Deploy"

### **Step 3: Test Your System**
Railway gives you a URL like: `https://your-app.up.railway.app`

```bash
# Test immediately
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/health
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/v1/test-data/status

# Chat with agents
curl -X POST https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/v1/agents/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Show me subjects with critical discrepancies"}'

# View API docs
open https://your-app.up.railway.app/docs
```

## âœ… **What You Get**
- 5 AI agents with real OpenAI SDK
- 50 synthetic subjects with clinical data
- Complete API for testing
- No real clinical data needed
- Instant testing capability

**That's it! Your clinical trials AI system is live on Railway.**

## ðŸ”§ Railway Configuration Fixed

### **Problem**: Railway tries to deploy entire repo instead of just `/backend`

### **Solution**: Use Nixpacks with `railway.toml` at root level
```toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"
buildCommand = "cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt"
startCommand = "cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT"
```

### **Manual Configuration** (if auto-detection fails):
In Railway dashboard â†’ Settings:

**Build Settings:**
- **Builder**: Nixpacks
- **Build Command**: `cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command**: `cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`

### **Environment Variables** (required):
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
USE_TEST_DATA=true
TEST_DATA_PRESET=cardiology_phase2
```

This ensures Railway only builds and deploys the backend service, not the entire repository.

## ðŸš¨ Railway Build Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Docker registry timeout/context canceled**
```
failed to copy: httpReadSeeker: failed open: context canceled
```

**Quick Fixes:**
1. **Try again** - Railway sometimes has temporary issues
2. **Use Alpine image** - Faster download (already updated in Dockerfile)
3. **Manually redeploy** - Click "Redeploy" in Railway dashboard

### **Issue: Build timeout (exit code 137)**
**Solution:** Railway free tier has limited resources
- Try deploying during off-peak hours
- Consider upgrading to Railway Pro ($5/month)

### **Alternative: Manual Railway Settings**
If `railway.toml` doesn't work, manually configure:

1. Go to Railway Dashboard â†’ Your Project â†’ Settings
2. **Build Command**: `docker build -f backend/Dockerfile backend`
3. **Start Command**: `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
4. **Root Directory**: `backend`

### **Last Resort: Simpler Deployment**
If Docker keeps failing, try Nixpacks:
1. Railway Settings â†’ Builder: `Nixpacks`
2. Root Directory: `backend`
3. Start Command: `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
