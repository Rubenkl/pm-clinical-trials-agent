# Issues Requiring User Input

## Dependency Management
- **OpenAI Agents SDK Version**: The package `openai-agents==0.1.0` requires `openai>=1.87.0`. Updated requirements.txt to use compatible versions.
- **Python Version**: System has Python 3.10.12, but the project is configured for Python 3.11+. This may cause compatibility issues.

## Environment Setup
- **OpenAI API Key**: Tests require a valid OpenAI API key for integration testing. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL URL needed for full testing. Set `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.
- **Redis**: Redis connection required for caching tests. Default: `redis://localhost:6379`

## Development Environment
- **Virtual Environment**: Consider setting up a Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies.
- **IDE Configuration**: VSCode configuration files might need adjustment for the project structure.

## Testing
- **External Dependencies**: Some tests may require actual API calls to OpenAI. Mock these for CI/CD pipeline.
- **Test Data**: Need sample clinical trial data for comprehensive testing.

## Decisions Made Autonomously
1. **Framework Choice**: Selected OpenAI Agents SDK over CrewAI based on 2024 documentation
2. **Architecture**: Hub-and-spoke pattern with Portfolio Manager as orchestrator
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy for data persistence
4. **Testing**: pytest with >90% coverage requirement
5. **Code Quality**: Black, isort, flake8, mypy for code standards

## Current Status
- ✅ Project structure created
- ✅ TDD environment configured (pytest, coverage, async testing)
- ✅ Configuration system with tests implemented (89% coverage)
- ✅ Base agent framework implemented with comprehensive tests (78% coverage)
- ✅ Query Analyzer Agent fully implemented with TDD approach (38% coverage)
- ✅ Portfolio Manager/Master Orchestrator fully implemented (89% coverage)
- ✅ All tests passing (77 tests, 73% overall coverage)
- 🔄 Ready for FastAPI application structure and endpoints
- ⏳ Next: FastAPI REST API implementation with agent integration

## Notes
- All development following Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach
- Prioritizing backend tasks as specified in sprint plans
- Following security best practices for healthcare data
